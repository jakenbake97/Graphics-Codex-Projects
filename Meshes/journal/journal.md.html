2020-09-02 @ 8:36 pm: Vertex indice order
=============================================
![Manually entered order of verticies]("CylinderVerts.jpg")
I finally figured out that I wasn't doing anything wrong it was because of the stupid "visual studio needs to rebuild completely" thing.

2020-09-02 @ 4:39 pm: Writing to off file
===========================================
- The .off file seems pretty easy to write (which is super nice), so I should be able to generate it through two loops (one for verts and another for faces)
- Having an issue with getting the TextOutput to open create the file with the two concatenated strings, so testing having the string literal added with the file name 
and then if that doesn't work I'll put in a single string literal.
    - The string literal for the relative path + the filename works, so I'll be able to use that for the rest of the project.
- The model looked nothing like a cylinder so my current theory is that i need to use radians instead of degrees
- converted to radians and the cylander works perfectly, the only issue is that it is inside out, so I need to reverse the order of indices
- I am having an issue loading my cylinder scene file for some reason, it is an exact copy of the cube scene so it should work, but isn't being found.
    - solution to this problem was that the file extension ".Scene.Any" wasn't capitalized.
    - nope, scene actually still isn't loading
    - ok I think it was file name since It worked in procedural scene. I think the issue was because i couldn't rename it in VS.

2020-09-02 @ 1:06 pm: Cylinder Development
========================================================
- It turns out that vertex colors are not used by default in the engine, so they can be anything in the .off file.
- I've found out that you can't have static const in C++ because there isn't a spot for it to be initialized.
- I believe I have a setup which will correctly generate a cylinder, now i just need to write the method that converts verticies and faces to an .off file.


 2020-09-01 @ 7:04 pm: OFF File Error
====================================
I'm having an issue with loading my OFF model, I thought maybe I had enterd my face wrond, but when I copied over a 
unit cube I was getting the same error. The error reads "model/cube.off: 1(1): Unrecognized token type begging with 
character '>>' (ASCII 187). This is the ASCII symbol for that code ╗

I created a new scene in visual studio associated with c++ and it loaded with no issues, therefore, I think that when I
Associated the files with text they were gettting some type of encoding on them that the parser could read. going to confirm my suspicion now.
So it isn't related to the file association, because I changed that in rider. For some reason the files created in rider
will not work while those in visual studio do. Rider mush be doing some form of encoding on the file when I don't want it to.

Also, important note is that faces are supposed to be counter-clockwise

2020-09-01: Reading Project Documentation/Instructions
=====================================================
I've begun reading through the instructions for this poject and want to document any thoughts or notes here for 
referenceas I continue to work on it.

- NGons and quads are ok, because G3D will automatically tessellate to triangles
- The .off file format is actually pretty simple, here is the [documentation]("http://www.geomview.org/docs/html/OFF.html") and an [example of a unit cube]("https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/off/unitcube.off").
- Rules state that there should be no colocated vertices, so they will need to use the indicies of the existing ones

[x] Axis-aligned cube with unit edge lengths, centered on the origin.
[x] Create a procedure to generate a cylinder with given radius and height.
[ ] Create UI for make cylinder
[ ] Create a procedure to generate a heightfield with elevation from grayscale
 [ ] Create UI for heightfield image selection and scale
[ ] Crete a procedure that generates a drinking glass from a contour by creating a solid of revolution
[ ] Create a visually interesting scene by combining elements from the program.
