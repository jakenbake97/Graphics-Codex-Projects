2020 -09-01 @ 7:04 pm: OFF File Error
   ====================================
   I'm having an issue with loading my OFF model, I thought maybe I had enterd my face wrond, but when I copied over a 
   unit cube I was getting the same error. The error reads "model/cube.off: 1(1): Unrecognized token type begging with 
   character '>>' (ASCII 187). This is the ASCII symbol for that code ╗
   
   I created a new scene in visual studio associated with c++ and it loaded with no issues, therefore, I think that when I
   Associated the files with text they were gettting some type of encoding on them that the parser could read. going to confirm my suspicion now.
   So it isn't related to the file association, because I changed that in rider. For some reason the files created in rider
   will not work while those in visual studio do. Rider mush be doing some form of encoding on the file when I don't want it to.
   
   Also, important note is that faces are supposed to be counter-clockwise

   2020-09-01: Reading Project Documentation/Instructions
=====================================================
   I've begun reading through the instructions for this poject and want to document any thoughts or notes here for 
   referenceas I continue to work on it.
   
   - NGons and quads are ok, because G3D willautomatically tessellate to triangles
   - The .off file format is actually pretty simple, here is the [documentation]("http://www.geomview.org/docs/html/OFF.html") and an [example of a unit cube]("https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/off/unitcube.off").
   - Rules state that there should be no colocated vertices, so they will need to use the indicies of the existing ones
   
   [ ] Axis-aligned cube with unit edge lengths, centered on the origin.
   [ ] Create a procedure to generate a cylinder with given radius and height.
   [ ] Create UI for make cylinder
   [ ] Create a procedure to generate a heightfield with elevation from grayscale
    [ ] Create UI for heightfield image selection and scale
   [ ] Crete a procedure that generates a drinking glass from a contour by creating a solid of revolution
   [ ] Create a visually interesting scene by combining elements from the program.
