2020-08-23 6:52 pm: Building out my scene design
==================================================
![Janky Ass House](2020-08-23__006_Janky_Ass_House.jpg)

Here is my completed scene in all its janky glory


Started building out my scene by placing a large ground block and then planning on building up from there into a nice house.

Couldn't get the skybox to update though. I'm not 100% sure which directory the cubemaps are from.

2020-08-23 5:59 pm: stairs in action
=============================================================
![Correctly Placed stairs](2020-08-23__005_Correctly_Placed_stairs.mp4)

stairs ended up having a larger rotation (14.4 degrees per cube)
and a position
based on the sin and cos of step number times - 14.4
to offset the rotation, and
then multiplied by 3 to give some space between them


![Second Attempt](2020-08-23__004_Second_Attempt.jpg)

Converting to rads and multipying by a constant gets us a lot closer, but now
the constant needs to be tweaked.
This initial test was 7.2 (which is 360/50)



![First test of textured cube stairs](2020-08-23__003_First_test_of_textured_cube_stairs.jpg)

This first test was generating 50 cubes and positioning them based on the cos(i)
for the x coord and sin(i) for the y coord.
To smooth out the curve of the
stairs I'm going to multiply by a constant (and convert to radians)


2020-8-23 @4:23 pm: Resume working on generating stair scene
================================================================

now that I have the general idea of what I need to do to build out the scene via code, I plan on generating the scene in a
few different "stages", starting with the header, the models section, and then the entities section.

@5:36, I have the full code written out (minus correct stair positioning), but I'm having some issues with getting the scene
to show up in the scene browser, there must be some issue with how it is being formatted.

2020-8-23 @2:31 pm: Creating the stair scene
=================================================

I began by creating a cpp file that was going to use ofstream to write strings to a file which could then be
interpreted as a scene, but after reading the advice section I decided to use the [TextOutput](http://casual-effects.com/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_text_output.html#details)
class from the G3D library, as that is what is reccommended to use. It also allows me to more visually create the file where
I'll be able to see if the info printed is going to be a string, text, symbol, number, etc. so as of 2:35 I'm switching to that.

Having trouble writing to the file using the TextOutput class, even when commiting data. Going to try setting the flush to false
to see if that helps, otherwise my next theory is to try the same thing with ofstream again to verify that my file path is actually
correct.

Turns out that I was accessigna nd writing to the file correctly, I just for some reason had to rebuild the solution because it
was running the old version of the file. Going to take a quick break and then get back into the actual writing of the file now.

2020-08-23 @1:24 pm: It's pronounced Cornell, and its the highest rank in the Ivy Leagues
=============================================================

![Added in the two interior cubes for the Cornell box, now just need to add an interior light source](2020-08-23__000_Added_in_the_two_interior_cubes_for_the_Cornell_box_now_just_need_to_add_an_interior_light_source.jpg)

![Added light to the cornell box. It looks a little wonky, but its there.](2020-08-23__001_Added_light_to_the_cornell_box._It_looks_a_little_wonky_but_its_there..jpg)

Had trouble getting the light to work at first, but managed to get it to shine once I looked at the documentation and the
declaration of the sun spotlight. The main thing that was throwing me was the *spotHalfAngleDegrees* property, I didn't
think that an area light would need a spot angle.

![Final Render of my Cornell box](2020-08-23__002_Final_Render_of_my_Cornell_box.jpg)

The light angle was increased and the power was drastically reduced

2020-8-23 @ 1:09 pm: Its pronounced Colnel, and its the highest rank in the millitary
========================================================================================
Resumed working on cornell box to position the two interior cubes, and the light source.



2020-8-22 @ 6:04 pm: My Cornell Box
==========================================================
Trying to figure out how I can create a frame for scaling a box and setting the material from the
entity page in the editior. currently thinking I may have to scale the box to a set size and then
rotate each entity to become walls. (stopped work at 6:22 pm because my grandparents arrived)

2020-08-22 @5:32 pm: Tilted Cube
=============================================================
![Gizmos Showing that the cube is properly rotated](2020-08-22__000_Gizmos_Showing_that_the_cube_is_properly_rotated.jpg)

![Better screenshot showing the bounds of the cube](2020-08-22__001_Better_screenshot_showing_the_bounds_of_the_cube.jpg)

This cube is positioned at (0,0,-2) and yawed (rotated around the vertical, y,
axis) 45 degrees


2020-08-22 @ 5:09 pm: Warmup
=====================================================

Completed the warmup and got doxygen finally working with the builddoc command.
This took roughly an hour when including the little bit of time spent playing
around with the scenes and a few of the debug features. So far, manually creating scenes
seems quite difficult since its not in an "actual language" and theres no code suggestions
for the various entities and objects.

2019-03-01: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press *F4* or *F6* in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to
this development journal.
