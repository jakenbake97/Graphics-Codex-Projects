2020-08-23 @1:24 pm: It's pronounced Cornell, and its the highest rank in the Ivy Leagues
=============================================================

![Added in the two interior cubes for the Cornell box, now just need to add an interior light source](2020-08-23__000_Added_in_the_two_interior_cubes_for_the_Cornell_box_now_just_need_to_add_an_interior_light_source.jpg)

![Added light to the cornell box. It looks a little wonky, but its there.](2020-08-23__001_Added_light_to_the_cornell_box._It_looks_a_little_wonky_but_its_there..jpg)

Had trouble getting the light to work at first, but managed to get it to shine once I looked at the documentation and the
declaration of the sun spotlight. The main thing that was throwing me was the *spotHalfAngleDegrees* property, I didn't
think that an area light would need a spot angle.

The light angle was increased and the power was drastically reduced

2020-8-23 @ 1:09 pm: Its pronounced Colnel, and its the highest rank in the millitary
========================================================================================
Resumed working on cornell box to position the two interior cubes, and the light source.



2020-8-22 @ 6:04 pm: My Cornell Box
==========================================================
Trying to figure out how I can create a frame for scaling a box and setting the material from the
entity page in the editior. currently thinking I may have to scale the box to a set size and then
rotate each entity to become walls. (stopped work at 6:22 pm because my grandparents arrived)

2020-08-22 @5:32 pm: Tilted Cube
=============================================================
![Better screenshot showing the bounds of the cube](2020-08-22__001_Better_screenshot_showing_the_bounds_of_the_cube.jpg)



![Gizmos Showing that the cube is properly rotated](2020-08-22__000_Gizmos_Showing_that_the_cube_is_properly_rotated.jpg)

This cube is positioned at (0,0,-2) and yawed (rotated around the vertical, y,
axis) 45 degrees


2020-08-22 @ 5:09 pm: Warmup
=====================================================

Completed the warmup and got doxygen finally working with the builddoc command.
This took roughly an hour when including the little bit of time spent playing
around with the scenes and a few of the debug features. So far, manually creating scenes
seems quite difficult since its not in an "actual language" and theres no code suggestions
for the various entities and objects.

2019-03-01: Formatting Notes
=====================================================
