2020-8-22 @ 6:04 pm: My Cornell Box
==========================================================
Trying to figure out how I can create a frame for scaling a box and setting the material from the 
entity page in the editior. currently thinking I may have to scale the box to a set size and then 
rotate each entity to become walls. (stopped work at 6:22 pm because gma nd papa arrived)

2020-08-22 @5:32 pm: Tilted Cube
=============================================================

![Gizmos Showing that the cube is properly rotated](2020-08-22__000_Gizmos_Showing_that_the_cube_is_properly_rotated.jpg)

This cube is positioned at (0,0,-2) and yawed (rotated around the vertical, y,
axis) 45 degrees


2020-08-22 @ 5:09 pm: Warmup
=====================================================

Completed the warmup and got doxygen finally working with the builddoc command.
This took roughly an hour when including the little bit of time spent playing 
around with the scenes and a few of the debug features. So far, manually creating scenes
seems quite difficult since its not in an "actual language" and theres no code suggestions
for the various entities and objects.
