                 **Project Report**

## System Overview
This project runs on the [G3D engine](https://casual-effects.com/g3d/www/index.html) and is the first project in the
[programming projects](http://graphicscodex.com/projects/projects/index.html) section of the graphics codex. While I don't
fully know how the G3D engine works yet, the main "environment" is controlled by the [App.cpp](../build/doc/html/class_app.html)
file. In App, the only thing I changed was adding in a call to the [StairGenerator.cpp](../build/doc/html/class_stair_generator.html)
This just generates the stair scene while the [onInit](../build/doc/html/class_app.html#a383cf8e8949745f9b2b10651b27d1724)
method is being run.

In [StairGenerator.cpp](../build/doc/html/class_stair_generator.html), I just write to a file all of the boiler plate code
I need in order to create a scene in G3D, Then I loop 50 times to create a "step" entity for each step of the staircase.
I generate an angle for the steps in radians from the loop iterator and a constant that I found to work well, then position
the step by taking the cos for the x axis (times another constant) and the sin for the z axis (times the same constant).
In between, the y axis is moved up by the iterator value multiplied by the height of each step, 0.5 units in this case.
The step is then yawed by the iterator multiplied with the same angle constant from earlier (in degrees this time), and that
wraps the interesting part of the scene.

## Coordinate System

![Example Coordinate System](../journal/2020-08-25__000_AxisDiagram.jpg)

The coordinate system in G3D follows a right hand rule, with the x-axis defaulting right, y-axis pointing up, and z-axis
point towards the camera. Instead of rotations being described as around an access, they are instead described as pitch,
roll, and yaw, like the rotation axes of a plane. All of the angular translations increase counter-clockwise when viewing
them from their respective axis' positive direction. I.e. looking at the pitch at the origin from the positive x-axis.

## Results

1. The first specification required me to create a single white 1m^3 rotated 45 degrees about the vertical (y) axis, which is yaw.

![First Specification, showing a 45 degree yaw to the white cube](../journal/2020-08-22__001_Better_screenshot_showing_the_bounds_of_the_cube.jpg)

2. The second spec wanted a model of the Cornell Box created by both editing a scene file and position the cubes in the scene

3. Specification three was the most difficult, it required me to texture map a curving staircase without manuially editing the scene
file or adjusting the scene in engine. To solve this, I created the StairGenerator (listed above) to create the scene file for me.

4. The final specification required me to create a scene of my own design containing at least 20 cubes. Thats where I created the
janky house, which features cubes of various sizes containing 6 different textures.

## Custom Scene Process

Creating my scene didn't take me too much time or effort (clearly), I was already pretty tired and I just wanted to move on to something
else. To create it I just found a few different textures online and then assigned them to a cube model in the scene file. I also set the scale
of each model and then added the entities for the model in my file. After creating all of the correct entities I launched the scene and
editied positions and rotations of each object there

## Typeset Test

\begin{equation}
\frac{df(x)}{dx}
= \lim\limits_{h \to 0}
\left\lbrack\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}\right\rbrack
\end{equation}

## Questions

   *1. What are the differences between the `Scene*` and `shared_ptr<Scene>` data types in C++?*
    
    A `Scene*` is a raw pointer to a scene object, essentially a pointer to a location in memory, while
    a shared pointer is similar ( a pointer to a scene object) it differs by having the number of usages counted
    so that it can be less likely to point to an already freed location in memory. This is a type of smart pointer
    because it comes with a bit of garbage collection built in.

   *2. How does G3D know where the scene files are located?*
    
    G3D requires scene files to be in the data-files folder (found after trying to load a scene from out side of it)
    and the sample scenes are just referenced in the actual engine code itself so that their location is also checked.
    While I couldn't find the actual code that looks in this specific folder, attempting to move a scene outside of the 
    folder confirmed that this must be the location for them. What's cool though is the the search seems to happen recursively
    because I can put my scenes in folders and they will still be found. The scene class has a function that sets the search
    paths for locating scenes, so in theory you could put a scene anywhere as long as you update the path to search.

   *3. Why should you to put your initialization code into `App::onInit` instead of constructor
   `App::App`?  (Tip: There are many reasons. Try throwing an exception from each, and consider
   the implications of throwing an exception from a class's constructor.)*
    
    Then main reason I can think of is so that if the constructor has an error then the code waitin to be initialized
    won't run preventing a whole mess of errors from files depending on others which didn't have their objects sucessfully created

    Plus, it feels strange to run external code in an object's constructor. The initialization function confirms that the app object
    exists and was sucessfully constructed.

   *4. What is the call chain that invokes `App::onGraphics3D`?*
    
    The full chain is pretty long, but jist of it is, `onGraphics3D` is called by onGraphics in GApp, which was caled by load scene
    in the same class which was called in the App's onInit event, which was called by GApp's beginRun, which was called from
    onRun, which was called by run, which was called by main.

   *5. Where is the file `cube.obj` stored on the file system?  How did the `Scene` parser know
   to load it from there?*

    The cube.obj file is in the engine files, in data10/common/model/cube. Like with the scenes themselves, the scene has a path to search
    where is should look for models (in this case there are actually multiple paths). It recursively searches for paths that meet the provided
    string in the scene file. For example, both the cube and crate are in a models folder, but in two different locations, so the scene just searches
    it's reference paths until it finds a file that has the correct path or runs out of files to search. This is a really cool system and actually
    much more advanced than I had anticipated.

   *6. You can create a material in a scene file from a `Color3`. There are many more ways to
   construct a G3D material, however. One of these takes separate `lambertian`, `glossy`,
   `emissive`, and `transmissive` values. Speculate on why a homogeneous material (i.e., one
   without a pattern or image) would require four separate "colors" in its specification.*

    Having the 4 seperate pieces of data allowsd for much more precise control of how the object interacts with light, creating a much
    more PBR appearance. Having just an rgb color will make the entire object that color only differing when the object is in direct light
    or shadow. The 4 color properties all take values which explain to the renderer how light should interact with the object, for example,
    the glossy most likely controls how much light is reflected directly at the viewing angle and the emissive determines the color of light 
    the object itself emits.

    ## Reflection
    
    For this just being the simple begginner project, I learned quite a bit. The code base is still very intimidating just because of how large it is
    but I do feel like I'm starting to make actual mental connections between the components I have discovered so far. This project's readings didn't
    teach me too much since they were primarily introductions, but I did learn some interesting C++ tips, like the = (assignment operator) actually has
    a copy call so it is more efficient to pass a value into an objects constructor `int x(5)` vs `int x = 5`. Writing the report was
    more difficult than I anticipated, but it really helped me to recal and confirm the things I learned so they are definately worth doing.


    ## Time

    Time for the general assignments took me 4:35, so right in the ballpark of the 5 hours estimated

    Then I spent an adition 30 mins actually designing my custom scene and 2:45 working on the report.

    So total time was ~ *7:44*
